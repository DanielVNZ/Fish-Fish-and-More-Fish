## 🐟 Fish, Fish and More Fish!

**Because your city needs more seafood.**
This mod introduces a temporary fishing industry system into Cities: Skylines II, giving you the power to harvest, process, and export fish—even before the official mechanics arrive.

---

### 🎣 What This Mod Does

- **Adds a Custom Fishing Industry Building**
- Drag out **fishing zones** across rivers or coastlines to gather fish from the water.
- Hook into your supply chain and build an economy powered by seafood.

- **Fish-to-Food Processing**
- Industrial buildings will automatically convert fish into food for general use.
- Supports population consumption and city growth.

- **Export and Economic Control**
- Fish can be traded at any cargo terminal.
- You can tax fish production like any other industry.

- **Fish Resource Refresher (Code Mod)**
- Fish regenerate every **5 minutes of real-world time** to prevent rapid depletion.
- Helps keep your fishing industry running smoothly—especially since fish don’t behave like other resources (yet).

### ⚠️ Temporary and Experimental

This mod is a **temporary solution** ahead of the official fishing mechanics. 

When Colossal Order releases the official **fishing update**, these assets **may break or become grey boxes**. You’ll be able to safely bulldoze them.
At that point, this mod will be **repurposed into proper, compatible fishing assets**.

### 🙏 Thanks and Credits

Big thank you to:
- **StarQ and Washy** – for development help and support.
- **Triton** – for letting me use parts of your ELT code to handle fish regeneration.

Enjoy fishing before it’s officially a thing!
